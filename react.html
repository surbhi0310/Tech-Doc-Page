                <h3>Single Page Application(SPA)</h3>
                <p>These are special web apps in which we only have one html page that is rendered.Any content we have to render or any interactivity, even going from one page to another all handled by js only.Interesting part is the app doesn't refresh while interacting or moving from one pg to another.</p>
                <p>When we write code in plain <B>Vanilla js</B>(normal js) the problem with this exist is- repetitive code; it's very hard to manage</p>

                <p>React is a JS library, it comes with a bare minimum set of functionalities using which we can make mordern SPA with ease. It doesn't bring a lot of conventions or baggage with it , and gives just the required functionalities for an SPA. </p>
                <p>This is a <b>problem of react</b> also, that for a lot of things we have rely on third party Solutions/libraries.</p>
                <hr>
                <b>React helps us to divide our UI into a set of reusable components </b><p>So react says, that just identify any piece of UI which is reusable in your page and make it a component(a resusable piece of UI implemented using react that we just plug and play anywhere in our UI. Components follow DRY Pinciple(do not repeat same piece of ui) heavily</p>
