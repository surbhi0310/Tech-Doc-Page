        <header>What is React?</header>
        <section>
            <article>
                <p>React is a JS library, it comes with a bare minimum set of functionalities using which we can make
                    mordern SPA with ease. It doesn't bring a lot of conventions or baggage with it , and gives just the
                    required functionalities for an SPA. </p>
                <p>This is a <b>problem of react</b> also, that for a lot of things we have rely on third party
                    Solutions/libraries.</p>
                <ol>Features of React are -
                    <li>React uses a <b>Virtual DOM</b> to optimize UI rendering. Instead of updating the entire real DOM directly, React</li>
                    <li>React follows a <b>component-based approach</b>, where the UI is broken down into reusable components.(can be functional & class based</li>
                    <li>React uses <b>JSX</b>, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML inside JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>React uses <b>one-way data binding</b>, meaning data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components via props.</li>
                    <li><b>State Management-</b>React manages component state efficiently using the useState hook (for functional components) or this.state (for class components). State allows dynamic updates without reloading the page.</li>
                    <li><b>Hooks</b> allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without needing class components.</li>
                    <li>React provides <b>React Router</b> for managing navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). It enables dynamic routing without requiring full-page reloads.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Components follow DRY Principle(do not repeat same piece of ui) heavily</p>
                <br>
                <h3>How to get started with React?</h3>
                <p>Tools to setup react -> create-react-app; NextJS; Vite(widely used)</p>

                Steps to setup React project with Vite:-
                <ul>(Do all this in terminal)
                    <li>Execute npm create vite@latest in </li>
                    <li>it asks for installation of create-vite say a yes(y)</li>
                    <li>Then it will ask for project-name, package name</li>
                    <li>Then select the "React" framework and Javascript as variant</li>
                    <li>And that's it you have your brand new react project with you.</li>
                    <li>Go insite the react projectby doing cd "name of the project"</li>
                    <li>Install dependencies "npm install"</li>
                    <li>Run the react server using "npm run dev"</li>
                    <li>Then go to your browser and open localhost:5173</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Let's discuss project structure:- </h3>
                <p>Let's go over every folder and file one by one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>package.json: </b>It is the most important files which contain metadata about the project. It
                        tells important details of the project like
                        <i>name of project, version of project(self configurable), scripts, it also tells the
                            dependencies which our project has. </i>For eg: dev script written is executed when we
                        execute npm run dev.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>node_modules: </b>This folder contains the downloaded dependency codes. For eg: we have
                        eslint react etc as dependency of the project</li>
                    <li><b>pakage-lock.json: </b>Now the dependencies we installed also have inner denpendencies, so
                        this file keeps the version details of al the dependencies and inner dependencies.So, if we
                        loose node_modules we can download the same version of everything because of this.</li>
                    <li><b>gitignore:</b>This file contains all the files and folders that we don't wat to upload on
                        github once we upload the project on github.</li>
                    <li><b>eslintrc:</b>This files keeps the eslint configuration.</li>
                    <li><b>vite.config.js:</b>This file keeps the react configuration.</li>
                    <li><b>public:</b>Any static file like pdfs, images etc goes here.</li>
                    <li><b>src:</b>Your Actual code is present.</li>
                </ul>

        <header>JSX</header>
        <section>
            <article>
                <p>JSX(extension to js) is an extention to XML, that's why the syntax of JSX looks extremely similar to
                    XML and HTML (HTML is also a derivative of XML only). Meta prepared JSX for making the UI
                    implementation more easy, because using plain JS functions that React and other technologies provide
                    can make the code unreadable. And with JSX, because it is a very HTML like syntax it becomes easy.
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looks and feels like HTML.</li>
                    <li>Has some minor differences compared to HTML.</li>
                    <li>Writing complex UI logic is easy with JSX.</li>
                    <li>Get's easily embedded with any JS code as well i.e in the same file we can write JS and JSX
                        together.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>JSX is not directly rendered as HTML by React; instead, it gets compiled into JavaScript objects representing virtual DOM elements. These objects are later used by React to efficiently update the real DOM.</p>
                <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250730170108961725/how_jsx_works.webp" alt="">
                Meta didn't intent to get JSX compatibility added in the browser or in EcmaScript but they intent that
                there should be a layer of transpilation that can convert JSX to normal JS code.</p>

                <!-- <h4>Example code for JSX:</h4>
                Using JSX to express UI components
                    var dropdown =
                      <Dropdown>
                        A dropdown list
                        <Menu>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something</MenuItem>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something Fun!</MenuItem>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something Else</MenuItem>
                        </Menu>
                      </Dropdown>; -->
                      
                <h4>Transpilation</h4>
                <p>It is the process of converting src code from one high-level programming languagr to another.
                    We use transpiler like <b>Babel</b> to convert JSX to compatible JS.To use JSX we need to make aa
                    file with .jsx extension.
                </p>
                
                
                <h3>Components</h3>
                <p>As we know componenets are reusable UI elements. And in normal proramming, functions helps us to put
                    reusable piece of code at one place.
                </p>
                <p>Now, In a react code base if we have a function that returns some kind of JSX, we will call that a
                    <b>Component or more specifically a Functional Component</b> because this component has been made
                    using functions. <i>We can make components using class also.</i></p>
                    <b style="color: blueviolet;">Defining a function</b>(function App(){return ...})<br>
                    <b style="color: blueviolet;">Calling a function </b> <"App /">(ignore inverted commas) <br>
                    <b>Note: </b>Name of a component must start with a capital letter else it will not work properly.The custom component must be in Pascalcase(like CustomComponent) and inbuilt HTML element based components like div, h1, h2 etc should be in lowercase.
