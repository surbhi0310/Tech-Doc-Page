                <p>These are special web apps in which we only have one html page that is rendered.Any content we have
                    to render or any interactivity, even going from one page to another all handled by js
                    only.Interesting part is the app doesn't refresh while interacting or moving from one pg to another.

        <header>What is React?</header>
            <article>
                <p>React is a JS library, it comes with a bare minimum set of functionalities using which we can make
                    mordern SPA with ease. It doesn't bring a lot of conventions or baggage with it , and gives just the
                    required functionalities for an SPA. </p>
                <p>This is a <b>problem of react</b> also, that for a lot of things we have rely on third party
                    Solutions/libraries.</p>
                <ol>Features of React are -
                    <li>React uses a <b>Virtual DOM</b> to optimize UI rendering. Instead of updating the entire real DOM directly, React</li>
                    <li>React follows a <b>component-based approach</b>, where the UI is broken down into reusable components.(can be functional & class based</li>
                    <li>React uses <b>JSX</b>, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML inside JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>React uses <b>one-way data binding</b>, meaning data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components via props.</li>
                    <li><b>State Management-</b>React manages component state efficiently using the useState hook (for functional components) or this.state (for class components). State allows dynamic updates without reloading the page.</li>
                    <li><b>Hooks</b> allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without needing class components.</li>
                    <li>React provides <b>React Router</b> for managing navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). It enables dynamic routing without requiring full-page reloads.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Components follow DRY Principle(do not repeat same piece of ui) heavily</p>

                <h3>How to get started with React?</h3>
                <p>Tools to setup react -> create-react-app; NextJS; Vite(widely used)</p>

                Steps to setup React project with Vite:-
                <ul>(Do all this in terminal)
                    <li>Execute npm create vite@latest in </li>
                    <li>it asks for installation of create-vite say a yes(y)</li>
                    <li>Then it will ask for project-name, package name</li>
                    <li>Then select the "React" framework and Javascript as variant</li>
                    <li>And that's it you have your brand new react project with you.</li>
                    <li>Go insite the react projectby doing cd "name of the project"</li>
                    <li>Install dependencies "npm install"</li>
                    <li>Run the react server using "npm run dev"</li>
                    <li>Then go to your browser and open localhost:5173</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Let's discuss project structure:- </h3>
                <p>Let's go over every folder and file one by one:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>package.json: </b>It is the most important files which contain metadata about the project. It
                        tells important details of the project like
                        <i>name of project, version of project(self configurable), scripts, it also tells the
                            dependencies which our project has. </i>For eg: dev script written is executed when we
                        execute npm run dev.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>node_modules: </b>This folder contains the downloaded dependency codes. For eg: we have
                        eslint react etc as dependency of the project</li>
                    <li><b>pakage-lock.json: </b>Now the dependencies we installed also have inner denpendencies, so
                        this file keeps the version details of al the dependencies and inner dependencies.So, if we
                        loose node_modules we can download the same version of everything because of this.</li>
                    <li><b>gitignore:</b>This file contains all the files and folders that we don't wat to upload on
                        github once we upload the project on github.</li>
                    <li><b>eslintrc:</b>This files keeps the eslint configuration.</li>
                    <li><b>vite.config.js:</b>This file keeps the react configuration.</li>
                    <li><b>public:</b>Any static file like pdfs, images etc goes here.</li>
                    <li><b>src:</b>Your Actual code is present.</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="jsx_react">
        <header>JSX</header>
            <article>
                <p>JSX(extension to js) is an extention to XML, that's why the syntax of JSX looks extremely similar to
                    XML and HTML (HTML is also a derivative of XML only). Meta prepared JSX for making the UI
                    implementation more easy, because using plain JS functions that React and other technologies provide
                    can make the code unreadable. And with JSX, because it is a very HTML like syntax it becomes easy.
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Looks and feels like HTML.</li>
                    <li>Has some minor differences compared to HTML.</li>
                    <li>Writing complex UI logic is easy with JSX.</li>
                    <li>Get's easily embedded with any JS code as well i.e in the same file we can write JS and JSX
                        together.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>JSX is not directly rendered as HTML by React; instead, it gets compiled into JavaScript objects representing virtual DOM elements. These objects are later used by React to efficiently update the real DOM.</p>
                <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250730170108961725/how_jsx_works.webp" alt="">
                Meta didn't intent to get JSX compatibility added in the browser or in EcmaScript but they intent that
                there should be a layer of transpilation that can convert JSX to normal JS code.</p>

                <!-- <h4>Example code for JSX:</h4>
                Using JSX to express UI components
                    var dropdown =
                      <Dropdown>
                        A dropdown list
                        <Menu>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something</MenuItem>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something Fun!</MenuItem>
                          <MenuItem>Do Something Else</MenuItem>
                        </Menu>
                      </Dropdown>; -->
                      
                <h4>Transpilation</h4>
                <p>It is the process of converting src code from one high-level programming language to another.
                    We use transpiler like <b>Babel</b> to convert JSX to compatible JS.To use JSX we need to make aa
                    file with .jsx extension.

                     <p>As we know components are reusable UI elements. And in normal proramming, functions helps us to put
                    reusable piece of code at one place.
                </p>
                <p>Now, In a react code base if we have a function that returns some kind of JSX, we will call that a
                    <b>Component or more specifically a Functional Component</b> because this component has been made
                    using functions. <i>We can make components using class also.</i></p>

                    <b style="color: blueviolet;">Calling a function </b> <"App /">(ignore inverted commas) <br>
                    <b>Note: </b>Name of a component must start with a capital letter else it will not work properly.The custom component must be in Pascalcase(like CustomComponent) and inbuilt HTML element based components like div, h1, h2 etc should be in lowercase.

                <h3>Props in React Components</h3>
                    <p>Props(short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.They enable communication between components  and are immutable.</p>
                <h3>States in React Component</h3>
                    <img src="https://i.sstatic.net/bwa5H.png" alt="">
                   <p> The state is a JavaScript object managed within a component, allowing it to maintain and update its own data over time. Unlike props, state is mutable and controlled entirely by the component. State updates trigger re-renders.</p>
                <h3>Rendering a Component</h3>
                    <img style="width: 500px;" src="https://ihatetomatoes.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/05-reactDOM-render.png" alt="">
                    <p>Rendering a component refers to displaying it on the browser. React components can be rendered using the ReactDOM.render() method or by embedding them inside other components.</p>
                <h3>Components in Components</h3>
                    <p>In React, you can nest components inside other components to build a modular and hierarchical structure.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>State refers to an object that holds information about a component's current situation.
                         This information can change over time(<b>Dynamic Data</b>), typically as a result of user actions or data fetching, and
                         <b>Triggers Re-renders</b>(when state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated UI).</p>
                    <h3>State v/s Props</h3>
                    <ul>While both state and props store data in React, they serve different purposes:
                        <li><b>State:</b> Managed within the component, mutable, and used to store dynamic data that changes over time.</li>
                        <li><b>Props:</b> Passed from a parent component to a child component, immutable, and used to share data between components.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, are among the most impactful updates to the library, with over 80% of modern React projects adopting them for state and lifecycle management. They let developers use state, side effects, and other React features without writing class components. Hooks streamline code, improve readability, and promote a functional programming style, making functional components as powerful—if not more—than their class-based counterparts.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Hooks</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h3>State Hooks</h3> State hooks, specifically useState and useReducer , allow functional components to manage state in a more efficient and modular way.</li>

                                <li><b>useState</b>(For managing component-local state.) </li>
                                <li><b>useReducer</b>(An alternative to useState for more complex state logic. </li>
